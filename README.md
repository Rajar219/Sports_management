# 🏅 Sports Management System

## 📖 About

This is a simple and functional Sports Management System developed as part of my BCA mini-project. The application helps manage key sports-related data for an institution, including player registrations, match schedules, and event tracking.

It is built using *PHP and MySQL*, with a focus on clean database design and easy-to-use forms for admins. This project reflects my ability to design and implement small-scale web-based CRUD systems.
